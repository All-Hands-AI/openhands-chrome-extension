## Real PR Example

The `real_pr_example.js` file demonstrates how the branch parsing works with a real PR example. This example simulates the DOM structure of a GitHub PR page and verifies that the branch parsing logic correctly extracts the source branch name.

To run the real PR example:

```bash
node tests/real_pr_example.js
```

### Example Output
